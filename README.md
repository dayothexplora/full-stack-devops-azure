# full-stack-devops-azure

 "This project demonstrates production-grade DevOps practices by deploying a 3-tier microservices application on Azure Kubernetes Service with full automation. It showcases end-to-end skills including infrastructure as code (Terraform), configuration management (Ansible), containerization (Docker), orchestration (Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins), and observability (Prometheus/Grafana) - proving I can design, build, and maintain enterprise cloud systems, not just follow tutorials."
